Overview:

When it comes to businesses, They need to worry about turnover. Due to the potentially high cost that the company will have to take on or the money that the company can lose. We will determine which factors contribute to employee turnover and make a prediction on which employees the company should invest in or not. In order to prevent turnover costs.

This notebook contains an in depth explanation of the results behind the analysis and reasoning behind the strategies I use within each project.

This is a classification problem where we will use different features to predict the likelihood of an employee turnover.
We look at the relationships between the features and targets.
Examine data with different visualizations using seaborn.
We will use models such as logistic regression and random forest classifer along with different metrics.
P.S - The numbers that are being used to further the analysis are just from google when it comes to an average of cost in regards to employee turnover
